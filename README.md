# __What to wear?__
### The app that solves the _'I have nothing to wear!'_ problem :)


If you don't remeber what's in your closet, or the cabinets are too inconvenient to look over the deep drawers in order to decide what to wear - just use this app.

- Create account (dummy authorization for now, will be fixed later)
- Add your clothes to data-base, provide an image or URL
- Get random outfit on the main page, or change the individual item by clicking on it

#### If you want to test the app with provided clothes, log-in as an existing user: 
 _PS  Please, don't delete all uploaded items :)_

#### Features that will be implemented in the nearest future:
- Suitable menu for desktops
- Real authorization and keeping user logged-in
- Implementation for remaining buttons
- Creating favourite outfits by user 
- Saving already 'used' outfits (so they won't occur again next time)
- Getting random outfits and items filtered by colour / weather / occasion
- Expanded item-form in order to provide tags reffering to weather / occasion etc.
- Possibility of adding one-piece items like dresses or jumpsuits
- Better User Experience
- and many more, as the app will grow :)
